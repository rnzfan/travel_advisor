# travel_advisor
A travel advisor app using React and APIs

This is a travel companion application that includes geolocation google maps API and google places API. It fetches API data based on the location data filtering. The application was built using Javascript and React. I followed the best practice to separate functions to different Components, pass Props, Props functions among them. I used useState hook to track state in a function component and useEffect hook to perform side effects in components. Using CircularProgress to control the loading progress of a particular region of a page.
